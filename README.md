# RandWireNN

This project is inspird by the paper 'Exploring Randomly Wired Neural Networks for Image Recognition' [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01569). In this project, we will look at different implmentation of randomly wired neural network, their characteristics, training complexity, and model performance.

The original paper mentioned three different kinds of random graph generator

Erdos-Renyi generated graphs on a fixed vertex set with a random number of edges, where each edge has a fixed probability of being present or absent, independently of the other edges. You can check some examples graphs generated by Erdos-Renyi by calling 
'python er.py [-n] [number of nodes] [-p] [probability of edges] [-o] [output]'
the result would be saved in model/[output], which can be visualized by calling
'python visualize [path/to/your/graph]'
